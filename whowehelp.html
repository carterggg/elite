				<br><h2>Individuals</h2>
					<br>
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Each of us has been made for a specific purpose in this life, although many of us find ourselves in circumstances that make this purpose unclear and difficult to find. It is often very hard to understand it all as we live it, but in hindsight the picture can become clearer. Therefore, we can aid you in becoming the best possible version of yourself by providing hope and healing for you and your circumstance.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">The counselors at Holy Family Counseling Center can help you achieve the highest level of healing, incorporating a holistic view of the person (body, mind and spirit) that is grounded in a deep understanding and respect for the dignity of the human person as a creation of God.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">It is our hope that you will find a haven with one of us to help you through the journey of your healing.</p>
				
			<p class="aboutsubheader">To make an appointment or for more information, please call Holy Family Counseling Center at 678-993-8494.</p>
			
			<p class="aboutsubheader"><i>Note: In an explanation of a faith-based practice, let is be understood that although our philosophy is based on our faith in God, this will never be imposed upon a client and it is contingent upon the client to decide how or if their own faith system will be incorporated explicitly into therapy. </i></p>

						<br><h2>Couples</h2>
					<br>
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Does your relationship feel stuck? Is your relationship with a loved one not as good as it used to be? We can help you thrive in your relationship. Relationships can be very complex, so we are here to help you grow as a couple by understanding each other and working together.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">In addition to finding individual healing and well-being, many of us desire healing within our personal relationships, especially marriage. We can help you to uncover ways in which you can get to know yourself and your spouse more deeply, more compassionately, and with deeper love.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">When chronic or serious  hurt has been present in the marriage, it is a wound to the bond with which God holds the two together.  We often want quick fixes and find it hard to believe that suffering is a part of love. Therapy is helpful in reducing suffering and helping you as a couple find ways to eliminate a large part of the suffering through incorporation of new coping methods, making changes in couple dynamics, communication, and ways of loving. In therapy, you will learn to discern ways of loving that you’ve either forgotten or never knew.  You will be aided in gaining insight into both yourself  and your spouse, empowering you to strengthen your bond and once again find pleasure in your relationship.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">To accomplish this, there will be individual sessions, couple sessions and possibly even family sessions - all according to your specific needs and issues.  Every relationship has the stages of honeymoon and disillusionment, but those blessed relationships that agree to move to the working stage can achieve acceptance (not settling) and intimacy, that amazing sense of loving, belonging, trusting which is the good which God created us to achieve.  Though this is hard earned, the joy of the end result is its own reward.</p>
				
			<p class="aboutsubheader">To make an appointment or for more information, please call Holy Family Counseling Center at 678-993-8494.</p>
			
			<p class="aboutsubheader"><i>Note: In an explanation of a faith-based practice, let is be understood that although our philosophy is based on our faith in God, this will never be imposed upon a client and it is contingent upon the client to decide how or if their own faith system will be incorporated explicitly into therapy. </i></p>

						<br><h2>Families</h2>
					<br>
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Do you find yourself wishing your family could just get along? Families are an incredible gift from God so we understand how significant it is for one’s family to bring about a sense of peace and home.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">It is beautiful to watch a family learn to love each other in new and improved ways and amazing to see how each family member affects the others so deeply- for the good and the bad. Family therapy can help your family strive for the greatest good, with the goal of providing a place of love and safety for each person so that they might all thrive. Life is already hard, but life without this safe haven can be debilitating. Providing the experience of relational healing allows for all to blossom. For this reason, therapy may include sessions with the parents and the children as appropriate for their needs and healing.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">It is our hope that your family will find a haven with us to help you through the journey of your healing.</p>

						<br><h2>Parents</h2>
					<br>
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Are you having trouble figuring out how to parent?</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Are you having trouble connecting with your child/children?</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">We know how difficult parenting can be, so the counselors at Holy Family Counseling Center can help guide you and provide skills and strategies that make a differnce.  It is beautiful to watch a family learn to love each other in new and better ways and amazing to see how each family member affects the others so deeply – for the good or the bad. Therapy helps parents strive for the greatest good, with the goal of providing a place of love and safety for each parent and for the child. Parenting help at Holy Family can provide the experience of healing and allow for all to blossom.

						<br><h2>Teens</h2>
					<br>
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Do you need help fully understanding your complex and changing identity, understanding your emotions, or coping with the pressures of alcohol and drugs? </p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Everyone knows how difficult, yet significant the teenage years truly are. These years encompass one trying to fit in all the while finding themselves as an individual. This stage of life comes with great misunderstanding, hormonal changes, rebellion, arguments, and general struggles.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Just as a couple is part of a “society” or “system” bigger than themselves (families of origin, the family they have created, friends, church community, workplace, et al) children and teens are even more at the mercy of the system they are a part of.   They are relatively helpless in improving their life circumstances without the help of parents.  With this in mind, parents are an integral part of their healing path.</p>
				<p class="aboutsubheader">If parents are unable or unwilling to participate, the child/teen can be led on a path for inner peace in a possibly difficult trial but this is usually a longer and harder road.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">It is beautiful to watch a family learn to love each other in new and improved ways and amazing to see how each family member affects the others so deeply- for the good and the bad. Therapy will help your  family strive for the greatest good, with the goal of providing a place of love and safety for each person so that they might all thrive and move into the vocation that their Creator intended for them. Life is already hard, but life without this safe haven can be debilitating. Providing the experience of healing of this haven allows for all to blossom. For this reason, therapy may include sessions with the parents and the children as appropriate for their needs and healing.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">The counselors at Holy Family want to support and guide you through this journey.</p>

						<br><h2>Young Adults</h2>
					<br>
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Do you feel that you could use help understanding your goals, aspirations, and direction in life?</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Do you need help healing and developing a love of life?</p>
				
				<p class="aboutsubheader">Holy Family Counseling Center offers counseling services for young adults. The young adult years are a vital time in life for identity formation. We can help guide you or your loved one in becoming self-aware and learning to navigate the adult world they are entering into.</p>
